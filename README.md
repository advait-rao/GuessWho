# GuessWho

The aim of this project is to run simulations of the board game **[Guess Who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F)** and see if there is actually a best way to play the game.

An optimal strategy can be obtained through Decision Theory. This project also aims to verify this strategy.
