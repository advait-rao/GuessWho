# GuessWho

The aim of this project is to run simulations of the board game **[Guess Who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F)** and see if there is actually a best way to play the game.

This project implements different strategies that can be invoked while playing a game of guess who, and runs simulations to test different strategies against each other. Itt also aims to verify the effectiveness of these strategies by testing them against a player with no strategy.
